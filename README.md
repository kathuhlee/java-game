Capstone 2 Instructions

Your task is to create a game of your choice, either a “clone” of an existing game, inspired by one, or completely original. The game logic should be written in Java, and the front end can be in either ASCII (text printed to console) or written using a Java graphics library (e.g.: JavaFX). When you submit your project, include your design documents in a top-level folder; these documents can be either digital files, or hand-drawn work. They must consist of:
• A UI Wireframe (even if your UI is only ASCII text)
• A UML Class Diagram
• A UML Program Flow Diagram
It is highly recommended to design your application first, before starting to code, creating user stories, etc. This doesn’t have to be reflective of your final product but will help you think through how to fit all the pieces together.
You must also include these designs in your pull request in a small, self-contained way (e.g.: no links to an online site, unless it doesn’t require the reviewer to sign in; no files/images/screenshots over 2MB).
